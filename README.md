I could not find the Java version of Unidata's
[UCAR Units](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/) available anywhere as
a standalone project, so I created this one. I restructured things a little to
use Maven as the build system.

Since this repository was created, the NetCDF team has split out the UCAR Units
project into its own Maven artifact and [published it to their Maven
repository](https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/content/repositories/unidata-releases/edu/ucar/udunits/).

So this fork should no longer be necessary or useful to anyone!
